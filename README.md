# chess

This project will serve as my final project in the 'Ruby Fundamentals' section of the Odin Project curriculum, and will involve me using all the skills I've learned so far to create a fully-functional version of the game, chess. Some of the skills I expect to make use/features I'd like to implement are:

- Using object-oriented programming, to keep the code clean and modular.
- Using serialization so a game can be 'saved' and resumed later.
- Using unicode characters to create a game board that is easily identifiable as being chess.
- Using the 'colorize' gem to add color to the game.

The fact that chess is such a robust game with a number of different rules, along with the fact that I myself do not know much about chess should make this a challenging, yet fulfilling project that will push both my coding skills, and my googling skills!

---- After finishing project ----

As expected, this project really did push everything I knew about Ruby. The game turned out to be much larger than any other project I had previously undertaken, and just when I would think that I had every I needed in a certain part of the game, something else would pop up that needed addressing or adding. 
That said, I did manage to fulfill all of the criteria I set for myself, including implementing a save and load feature to the game, something I've only had experience implementing in a much smaller game before.

I hope to work further on this game in the future, both adding new features, and improving some of what's already implemented. Some of what I hope to implement in the future is:

- Cleaning up some of the code, and removing all of the as of yet uncleared rubocop errors. (As of writing these are mostly to do with class length, something that will most likely require me to rethink my class structure.)
- Implement 'castling' and 'en passant'.
- Improve the UI -- while very much fit for its job, the current UI could be updated both aesthetically and functionally in the future to improve the overall game experience.
