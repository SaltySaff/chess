# chess

This project will serve as my final project in the 'Ruby Fundamentals' section of the Odin Project curriculum, and will involve me using all the skills I've learned so far to create a fully-functional version of the game, chess. Some of the skills I expect to make use/features I'd like to implement are:

- Using object-oriented programming, to keep the code clean and modular.
- Using RSpec for testing.
- Using serialization so a game can be 'saved' and resumed later.
- Using unicode characters to create a game board that is easily identifiable as being chess.
- Using the 'colorize' gem to add color to the game.

The fact that chess is such a robust game with a number of different rules, along with the fact that I myself do not know much about chess should make this a challenging, yet fulfilling project that will push both my coding skills, and my googling skills!
